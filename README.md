## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description

The mount is the second part of the castor, and is a 120mm x120mm rectangle, centered on the origin.It has 4 symmetric holes in the corners, and one in the center of the square.

### Reflection

This assignment was much easier than the first one, just becuase I had a mouse, and I'm getting used to usin onshape. The video directions are very helpful, and I having fun designing things.

## Fork

### Description

The fork is a pretty cool design where you use tons of different features, such as filet. The base of the fork is a circle with 80 mm diameter.

### Reflection

Honestly this assignemnt was not hard at all, Dr shields videos once again made it super easy. It was cool using some new stuff such as filet that we haven't used as well.

## Tire

### Description

The tire is an interesting design because we revolves it. It has two dimensions on the right, that go into nothing, but that's how you demonstrate that you want t extrude this design.

### Reflection

This was a fun assigment that took a couple tries for me, but I got it eventually. I'm still really enjoying onshape and designing the castor.

## Wheel

### Description

The wheel starts with 3 rectangle sketches, then gets revolved, and becomes a wheel! It has spokes as well.

### Reflection

This assignment took me a couple tries, but once I figured it out it was easy. One thing to remember is that sometimes you need to fully restart and follow everything he does to get it right.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description

The axlecollarbearing is a 3 part assignment, first you make the axle, then you put on the collar, and finally attach the bearing by using on old part, the wheel.

### Evidence

I could not log into onshape for some reason, but the part is finished 

### Image

I could not log into onshape for some reason, so I couldnt take the screenshot, but it's finished 

### Reflection

This part was really tricky for me, I was almost finished, but I could not figure out a part about the collar. So I restarted and focused on following Dr.Sheilds step by step, it worked!
